## Introduction
It might be a challenge to choose where to live in Toronto when you decide to move or open a business. In this project, we built a database that analyzes the crime rate, income range, house prices, and population of each neighbourhood in the GTA. Our goal was to analyze these data points and find correlations between them. As a bonus, we also included a Starbucks location analysis to determine if the locations of Starbucks in the GTA were affected at all by the factors stated above. 

## Data Extraction
In this project we extracted, transformed, and loaded different types of datasets as Income, Crime, Rental House Prices, Red Light Camers, Speeding Count and Starbucks locations.

* Our main sources:
  * Toronto Neighbourhood Data - Toronto City Open Data
  * Toronto Neighbourhood Income - Toronto City Open Data
  * Toronto Crime Data - Toronto City Open Data
  * Toronto House Price - Toronto City Open Data
  * Red Light Cameras - Kaggle
  * Speeding Count - ArcGIS API
  * Starbucks Locations - Kaggle

- We make an API call on

## Data Engineering </br>

## Data Transformation
- We used a Pandas functions in Jupyter Notebook to transform all CSV files, scraped data, and API request responses.
- We reviewed the files and transformed into a dataframes.
- We used a python transformation functions for data cleaning, joining, filtering, and aggregating.
- Several columns removed
- Duplicate rows was removed, and successfully managed.
- We conducted some aggregation to find totals for comparison in the datasets.

## Load

- Income Table
- Crime Table
- Starbucks Table
- Red Light Cameras Table
- Speeding Table
- House Rental Prices Table

## Analysis and Insights

Questions answered:- </br>
* **Which areas in Toronto have high average income?** </br>
  * Answer: Midtown Neighbourhoods (i.e. Bridle Path-Sunnybrook-York Mills, Lawrence Park South) </br>

- **Which areas in Toronto have high crime rates?** </br>
  * Answer: Downtown & Northwest (i.e. Bay Street Corridor, Church-Yonge Corridor, Kensington-Chinatown) </br>

- **Is there a higher crime rate in lower income regions?** </br>


- **Is there a correlation between house prices and crime rates?** </br>

- **Are there more Starbucks locations in higher income neighborhoods?** </br>

#### Crime Rate and Income Correlation </br>
There's a negative correlation between Average Crime Rate and Average Income. </br>
Low Income area has higher crime rate. </br>
R value -> negative relationship. </br>
p-value<0.005 -> A statistically significant test result </br>
The stacked bar graph shows Crime Count per neighborhood for each Income Group which depicts lower income regions have higher crime rate per neighborhood.</br>
#### Red Light Cameras Analysis </br>
From the graphs above, we can see that the majority of red light cameras are implemented in regions with an average income of 50-100K. Comparing this with the total number of speeding tickets per income region we see that the same income region holds the most amount of speeding tickets. We can conclude from this that red light cameras are not necessarly placed in low income regions, but more-so regions where speeding is more commonplace. </br>
#### House Prices and Crime Rate </br>
It seems that there is a very weak negative correlation between crime rate and house prices.</br>
#### Starbucks Locations Analysis </br>
The Number of Starbucks Stores vs. Average Income scatter plot shows that it seems that there is no correlation between starbucks stores location and income. </br>
#### Heat Maps Analysis
* Looking at the heat map of Average Income by Neighbourhood, it seems that midtown neighbourhoods generally have higher average income, and Downtown and Northwest tend to have higher crime rate. 
* Seeing the heat map of Crime Rate by Neighbourghood, it seems that downtown and northwest areas tend to have higher crime rates. 
* The heat map of the number Starbucks stores by neighbourhood in Toronto shows stores are significantly concentrated in downtown area. Especially, in one neighbourhood called ‘Bay Street Corridor’, there are 26 stores. We can assume that foot traffic than the average income would be a more important factor for Starbucks Locations. In other words, neighbourhoods where there are a lot of offices and businesses tend to have more stores.
